# Developer Preview

Developer preview is a way for developers to get access to new Nexmo products before they are more widely available.

At this point in a product's lifecycle there is no usage charge, limited support and little developer tooling. All features are expected to work as intended.

## Support

For support with Developer Preview APIs, please join our [community Slack channel](/slack)

## Documentation

API documentation and `curl` examples for common use cases are available.

## Client Libaries

The feature is supported in our `node` client library but no others.
